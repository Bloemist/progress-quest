Thanks to recent advances in browser technology, it has been possible
to port Progress Quest to run right in your browser. It wasn't easy;
we started with hardware emulation of a 80386-equipped PC clone
running a novel Windows XP compatable operating system called ProgrOS,
implemented in a clean room in the Seychelles by a team of people who
had never programmed before (to ensure no copyrights would be
violated).

Unfortuantely that wan't fast enough (too much lag death), so we
instead emulated the much faster Cray-2 supercomputer and ran the
80386 emulator in that. But the 80386 kept getting hot, so we switched
to a 6502 overclocked at 120GHz with emulated liquid helium coolant,
and ported ProgrOS to that.

That seems to work pretty well with many of the modern browsers
(Chrome, Firefox, Safari). At the moment Opera seems to work just
okay, and Internet Explorer has some real problems. (But if you're
running IE, you're on Windows, and so just download the game!) Things
aren't as good as they could be on touchscreen devices such as the
iPad yet either.

This edition of the game is only single player - the saves exist only
on your local machine, and there is no Hall of Fame yet. If anyone
cares, that will come later.
